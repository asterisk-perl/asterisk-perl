Asterisk Perl Modules
by James Golovich <james@gnuinter.net>


These are all modules for interfacing with the Asterisk open source pbx
system.

The main site for these files is http://asterisk.gnuinter.net, or soon
to be found at a CPAN mirror near you.

Some documentation is in the the perl modules, use perldoc to read it
(example: perldoc Asterisk::AGI)

To install these modules just do:
	perl Makefile.PL
	make all
	make install


Asterisk can be found at http://www.asteriskpbx.com
